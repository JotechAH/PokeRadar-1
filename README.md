# PokeRadar for Minecraft Pixelmon
- New Boss colors with nameplates and waypoints
- Search multiple pokemon by separating with commas eg: pikachu, magikarp, mew
- NPC detection
- PokeLoot detection
- PokeShrine detection
- Mega boss detection
- Filter by Nature
- Filter by Effort Value (EV). Search by specifically HP, Attack, Defense, Sp.Attk, Sp.Def, or Speed. A pokemon will show up if it has only that EV.
- PokeRadar automatically checks for updates
- Right click a Pokemon to view *basic* stats on it
- Clicking the "Stats" tab will show two new tabs: **IV** and **EV**. These new tabs reveal hidden information about your Pokemon.
- Choose between colored dots or pokemon textures on your map
- Add colors to your pokemon's name and increase the limit on name size
- More optimization

## Information

This is the original PokeRadar for Pixelmon. Detect any pokemon in your area, level, location, and if they are shiny. Search for specific pokemon or multiple pokemon at once with commas. Automatic waypoints and for bosses and legendaries in your area. Find PokeLoot and Shrines with ease. Filter by Effort Value (EV) and for faster training! You can enter a partial spelling (minimum 3 letters) for a pokemon and PokeRadar will find it. Use the in-game menu to configure Map settings.
